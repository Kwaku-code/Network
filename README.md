This project provides a description of the types of networks that can be encounted and provide examples and the context in which each network might be used. The project also provides an explanation of the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and how it different it is from other models like LSM and LPCM. The project implements the LSM and SBM algorithm using the ClintonEmails data. In implementing the SBM for instance, we find 4 clusters densely populated showing a lot of email exchanges within these communities. Also we find a group within these communities who do not exchange a lot of messages within this commuities. We also try to recover the clusters that exchanged a lot of emails with the words ‘LIBYA’ or ‘Libya’ within the exchanges and we find three communities exchange a lot of messages with the word ‘LIBYA’ or ‘Libya’ in the message whereas we also find a group within this community who do exchange information on this topic.
